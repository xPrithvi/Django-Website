# Django Website on COVID-19

The following repository was a school-based project in which we aimed to create a meaningful website. Using Justin Mitchel's Udemy course on Django: https://www.udemy.com/course/try-django/ and Rafeh Qazi's YouTube Django tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw, a basic Django blog website was created that features articles covering the COVID-19 pandemic. The articles featured are listed below: 

- **Racism & COVID-19** written by Prithvi Ramrucha.

- **Post-COVID China** written by Yash Soobarah

- **Mauritius: Economic Impact of COVID-19** written by Shaan Dussoye.

- **South Korea Prevails Against COVID-19** written by Brandon Lee.
